                <h2>Topic and Purpose</h2>
                <p>I'm creating a webpage about the book I'm currently writing. It doesn't contain all the 
                    comprehensive data I've created and collected about my book, but the essential elements and 
                    parts I don't believe will need changing are there. 
                </p>
                <P>
                    I'm hoping this can be a way to present my book idea to literary agents, publishers, professors, 
                    and anyone interested. The website could prove to be a way to explain my book and give my readers 
                    the chance to explore.
                </P>
                <h3>Features</h3>
                <p>
                    Homepage:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The World-Building section separates four sections of text into div tags that 
                            also have images. The sections appear as circular images, so once the user hovers 
                            over the images, the image fades (transition) and the text appears.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            The Writing Sample section shows an iframe of a pdf that is a sample chapter from my book.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul> 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Characters Page:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Every character section has an accordion transition that reveals the character's wants and needs. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Every character section also has a Slickbox JQuery Plugin that shows the character's aesthetics 
                                as a gallery. The first image is their eye color, hair color, favorite color, and 
                                their skin color. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plot Outline:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The beat sections (images and text boxes) transform by slightly enlarging.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The navbar also has a sub-menu for the Homepage that takes the user to the Contact section, only 
                                homepage specific though.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
